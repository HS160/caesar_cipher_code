# Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

This Python script implements a simple Caesar Cipher encoder and decoder. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

## Features

- Encode messages using Caesar Cipher
- Decode messages encrypted with Caesar Cipher
- Supports lowercase letters and preserves non-alphabetic characters
- Interactive command-line interface

## How to Use

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Choose whether you want to 'encode' or 'decode' a message.
3. Enter the message you want to process.
4. Specify the shift number (how many positions each letter should be moved).
5. View the result.
6. Choose whether to continue with another operation or exit the program.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

No additional installation is required. Simply download the script and run it with Python.

```
python caesar_cipher.py
```
